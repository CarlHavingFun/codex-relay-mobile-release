- Open Sponsors for recurring support from users/teams.

2. Gumroad
- Sell digital package (skill bundle, templates, setup guide) and membership.
- Good for direct-link sales from social posts.

3. Lemon Squeezy
- Good if you want merchant-of-record style global selling and subscriptions.
- Important: review prohibited services list before listing service-heavy offers.

4. PromptBase
- Sell a simplified prompt/automation playbook version as a product.
- Works better for lightweight "template" SKU than full private deployment.
